You shouldn't use FOR for array

When use FOR for object
FOR IN enumerates the property names (or keys) of an object. On each iteration, another property name string from the object is assigned to the variable.
It is usually necessary to test object.hasOwnProperty(variable) to determine whether the property name is truly a member of the object or was found instead on the prototype chain.

for (myvar in obj){
	if (obj.hasOwnProperty(myvar)){
		...
	}
}

flight.number // get value of flight["number"]
But to ensure that it does not use an property on the prototype chain

flight.hasOwnProperty("number")
