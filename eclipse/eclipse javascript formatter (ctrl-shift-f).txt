The problem can be solved by accessing

Preferences > JavaScript > Code Style > Formatter
Proceed:

Create a new profile (since you cannot edit the builted-in one), if you haven't already, and click Edit....
Open the Line Wrapping tab.
In the Maximum line width field, enter 9999.
Click Apply, and Ok.
The problem shows up again for code lines that have more than 9999 characters, but I can live with that.
