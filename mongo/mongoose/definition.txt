Mongoose is an ODM (Object Document Mapper). Using an ODM, we can map these simple documents (table rows) into full-form Javascript objects.

Mongo is NoSql Database .

If you doesn't want to use any MAPPER for your data models then you can also use native driver mongo.js https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native.

Mongoose is one of the orm's who give us functionality to access the mongo data with easily understandable queries.

Mongoose plays as a role of abstraction over your database model.
