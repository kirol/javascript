We don't have to refactor the database or take it offline while we upgrade the schema, we simply add a couple of entries to the Mongoose schema. If a key requested in the schema doesn't exist, neither Mongoose nor MongoDB will throw errors, Mongoose will just return null values. When saving the MongoDB documents, the new keys and values will be added and stored as required. If the value is null, then the key is not added.
