What to do when AngularJS does not work?
1. Check if <html ng-app="myApp"> has the correct name or not
2. In case you are using custom directive: 

In the file which is used to define custom directive, its name (w3TestDirective) must use a camel case name
app.directive("w3TestDirective",function(){
  return {
    template: "<h1>Custom directive</h1>"
  }
});

In the html file (view), to invoke this custom directive you have to use - separated name, w3-test-directive
<w3-test-directive></w3-test-directive>


3. ReferenceError: function is not defined in javascript
This part is problematic (among a few others):

onclick=openWebsite(url);
You need to use angular's build-it directive ng-click

<ons-col ng-click="openWebsite(url)">
If you use onclick, you register a native handler for the click event and the browser tries to find the openWebsite() function in the global (window) scope (note: no relation to Angular scopes), where it does not exist.

If you use ng-click, on the other hand, Angular will search for the openWebsite() method in the corresponding scope, which is what you want.


4. Function does not work
Change
function saveManageClassesFunc() {}
To
$scope.saveManageClassesFunc = function() {}
