What to do when AngularJS does not work?
1. Check if <html ng-app="myApp"> has the correct name or not
2. In case you are using custom directive: 

In the file which is used to define custom directive, its name (w3TestDirective) must use a camel case name
app.directive("w3TestDirective",function(){
  return {
    template: "<h1>Custom directive</h1>"
  }
});

In the html file (view), to invoke this custom directive you have to use - separated name, w3-test-directive
<w3-test-directive></w3-test-directive>
