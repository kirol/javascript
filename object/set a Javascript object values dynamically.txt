In case you can not set or update data to object, remember that you have to define the object first by using var myObj = {}. data is a tmp obj, user.projects is an existing obj, so if we want to update this existing obj, we need to set it to empty first before update it.

We can do the same steps if user.projects is an array

var data = {};
var data = user.projects;
data[i][projectType][j]["classView"] = testJson;
user.projects = {}; // we need to set it to empty 
user.projects = data;
user.markModified(user.projects);

var myObj = {};
myObj[key] = value;
