The first part of the JavaScript code that we wrote is .select("body").

The D3.js Select method uses CSS3 selectors to grab DOM elements. To learn more about CSS3 selectors please check this out => CSS3 Selectors

D3 looks at the document and selects the first descendant DOM element that contains the tag body.

Once an element is selected, D3.js allows you to apply operators to the element you have selected.

These operators can get or set things like "attributes", "properties", "styles", "HTML", and "text content".
